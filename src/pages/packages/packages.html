    <h5>Manuel Antonio Park Deluxe</h5>
    <p>Do not miss out on one of Costa Rica’s biggest treasures- the Manuel Antonio National Park with this exclusive tour.<br>

        Take a comfortable hike with a certified guide, trained in education and the exploration of our bio-diversity which consists of a lush tropical forest that has been preserved for over 40 years. Explore the secluded beaches of the park and the exceptional variety of flora and fauna.<br>
        
        The pace of this adventure is determined by the skills and interests of your group, and the amount of wildlife you wish to observe. Sloths and numerous species of monkeys are traveling through the treetops, anteaters and iguanas are resting in the tropical jungle and the songs of the various birds will ensure an unforgettable experience. Be attentive and hopefully we will be able to find one of the remaining Monos Titis or squirrel monkeys of which only 1000 are left worldwide. This endangered species lives in only one place in the world, the biological corridor of the Manuel Antonio National Park. To round up the tour you will be able to dip your feet into the crystal clear water at the beautiful beaches of the park.<br>
        
        What makes this tour deluxe, are the later pickups around 9:30, which leads to avoiding the long lines at the park gate in the earlier hours. Instead of a snack, on this tour you receive a full lunch afterwards. Additionally the deluxe tours are limited to a maximum of 8 people.</p>
